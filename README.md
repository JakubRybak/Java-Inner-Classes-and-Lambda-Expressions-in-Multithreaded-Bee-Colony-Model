# Bee Colony Simulation in Java: OOP, Multithreading, and Lambda Expressions

## Project Overview
This project simulates the life of a bee colony using Java. It applies advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, multithreading, inner classes, anonymous classes, and lambda expressions to manage various aspects of bee behavior, including the queen's mating flight, worker bees gathering nectar, and drones contributing to the colony. The project is designed to demonstrate efficient encapsulation, use of functional interfaces, and Java's concurrency model.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core language for implementing OOP, threading, and lambdas.
- **Multithreading**: Java's concurrency model manages multiple threads for realistic simulation.
- **Lambdas & Functional Interfaces**: Lambda expressions for concise functional programming and custom comparators.
- **Encapsulation and Class Design**: Emphasizes encapsulation by using access modifiers and static, abstract, and inner classes.
